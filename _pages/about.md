I am currently a Ph.D candidate in the [Human-Robot Interfaces and Interaction Lab, Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://hri.iit.it) and [NearLab, Politecnico di Milano](https://nearlab.polimi.it/medical/), with the guidance of [Dr. Arash Ajoudani](https://hri.iit.it/our-staff-details/-/people/arash-ajoudani) and [Prof. Elena De Momi](https://nearlab.polimi.it/medical/elenadem/).
Previously, I received my B.Eng degree in mechanical engineering from Zhengzhou University in 2018 and the M.Eng degree in the same major from the School of Mechanical Engineering and Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robots, Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University in 2021.
My research focuses on robot learning, mobile manipulation and impedance control.
